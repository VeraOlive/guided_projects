# Exploring Ebay Car Sales Data using Pandas

## Dataset
In this project, I analyse a dataset composed of information about used cars announced on the classifieds section of the German eBay website, *eBay Kleinanzeigen*. The original dataset, scraped and uploaded to Kaggle by user orgesleka, is no longer available, but can now be found [here](https://data.world/data-society/used-cars-data). This analysis is done using a smaller subset of that dataset, which has been further "dirtied" for learning purposes. That dataset is available in the repo of the project under the name `autos.csv`.

## Tools
I used Pandas to explore, clean and analyse the data, answering some questions such as how old were the cars advertised, the top most common brands and the correlation between average price and mileage.

This project is a part of the [Data Scientist in Python](https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-scientist/) course on Dataquest.
